# Hack-Computer
The project involves creation of a Computer named "HACK" from the basic principles of electronics . 
A typical Computer Architecture is based on the set of elementary gates working together in the background.The first step that is taken here is building chips such as Full Adders , Muxes , Demuxes from the Universal Nand Gate. 
The centerpiece of the computer's architecture is the CPU, or Central Processing Unit, and the centerpiece of the CPU is the ALU, or Arithmetic-Logic Unit.Here the ALU is designed using MUXes and DEMUXes along With some Adders and Incrementer. 
The computer's main memory, also called Random Access Memory, or RAM, is an addressable sequence of n-bit registers, each designed to hold an n-bit value.A Sequential circuit based RAM is constructed from Muxes, D flipflops and Clock . 
The Central Proccessing Unit (CPU) is built using the A and D registers connected to the Program Counter. 
The Hack Computer is then designed using the previously built chips along CPU chip piped with a screen and a keyboard.This results with a general purpose computer that can programs written in the Hack Machine Language.
